## About Enceladus

Enceladus is a project that seeks to facilitate and at the same time brings a complete kit for users to create homebrew software for PlayStation 2 using the Lua language. It has dozens of built-in functions, both for creating games and apps. The main advantage over using Enceladus project instead of the pure PS2SDK is above all the practicality, you will use one of the simplest possible languages to create what you have in mind, besides not having to compile, just script and test, fast and simple.

### Function types:
* System: Everything that involves files, folders and system stuff.
* Graphics: You can control the entire 2D part of your project, that is, draw images, shapes, lines, change their properties, etc.
* Render: 3D! Basic support for rendering a 3D environment in your project.
* Screen: The entire screen of your project (2D and 3D), being able to change the resolution, enable or disable parameters.
* Font: Functions that control the texts that appear on the screen, loading texts, drawing and unloading from memory.
* Pads: Above being able to draw and everything else, A human interface is important. Supports rumble and pressure sensitivity.
* Timer: Control the time precisely in your code, it contains several timing functions.
* Sound: Basic sound functions.

New types are always being added and this list can grow a lot over time, so stay tuned.

### Built With

* [PS2DEV](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev)
* [Lua](https://github.com/ps2dev/lua)

## Coding

In this section you will have some information about how to code using Enceladus, from prerequisites to useful functions and information about the language.

### Prerequisites

Using Enceladus you only need one way to code and one way to test your code, that is, if you want, you can even create your code on PS2, but I'll leave some recommendations below.

* PC: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)(with Lua extension) and [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net/download/development/dev-windows.html)(1.7.0 or above) or PS2Client for test.
* Android: [QuickEdit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhmsoft.edit&hl=pt_BR&gl=US) and a PS2 with uLE for test.

Oh, and I also have to mention that an essential prerequisite for using Enceladus is knowing how to code in Lua.

### Features
